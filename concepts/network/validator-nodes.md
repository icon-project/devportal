# Validator nodes

### What is a Validator node? <a href="#why-should-i-run-an-ethereum-node" id="why-should-i-run-an-ethereum-node"></a>

From the glossary, a [Validator node](https://icon.community/glossary/validator-node/) is defined as follows:

> Block validator for the ICON network. Transaction processors for operations that change the state of the ICON network. Typically representing an end-user group that has made important contributions to the ICON network. Typically encouraged to incentivize the at-large ICON Community for participation and to help increase the value of the ICON network

Validator nodes write to the ICON blockchain. They do this by [processing transactions](../../icon-stack/icon-execution-environments/) on individual nodes and then [forming a consensus](../computational-utilities/consensus-mechanism.md) with other nodes.

It is not possible to access a Validator node publicly. This serves to reduce the amount of work that a Validator node must do, which allows them to operate faster and more accurately. All public access to ICON occurs through an [API Endpoint](api-endpoints.md).

### Why run a Validator node?

Running a Validator node increases diversity within the ICON network. Diversity lowers the chances of a network attack through a malicious user. Running a Validator node also increases your value to the community, because you are now opening yourself as a possible [Delegate](../governance/delegates.md), which means that you would take on part of the responsibility of ensuring that the network operates properly.
