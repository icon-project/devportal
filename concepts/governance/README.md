# Governance

### What is Governance?

From the Wikipedia page on [_Governance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance):

> **Governance** is all the processes of interactions be they through the [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law), [norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social\_norm), [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power\_\(social\_and\_political\)) or [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language) of an organized society[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#cite\_note-1) over a [social system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social\_system) ([family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family), [tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe), [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal\_organization) or [informal organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal\_organization), a [territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory) or across territories).

In the context of cryptocurrency, governance is related to the network processes like block creation, but also to the person-to-person processes like ecosystem development.

### How is ICON governed?

The ICON Network is a community-run organization. This is reflected in many ways, including that the large majority of projects from the [official ICON project are open-sourced on Github](https://github.com/icon-project).

The main blockchain-based network, as an extension of the [computational network structure](../network/), contains community members with raised roles and responsibilities as voted upon by the community. These raised-role members are called [_delegates_](delegates.md), who are responsible for proposing changes for the purpose of improving network state given current context and future goals. These are referred to as [_network proposals_](network-proposals/).
