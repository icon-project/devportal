# ICON networks

### What are the different ICON networks?

At current, there are two main classes of ICON networks:

* ICON execution environment-based
* EVM-based

For each type, it is possible to have many different actual networks running. Both types are based on publicly available protocols, the first on [goloop](../../concepts/computational-utilities/goloop/) and the second on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/).

### Which network should I choose?

The main differences between the two networks are the development environment and the ease of access to products of interest. In short, choose the main [ICON network](main-network.md) if you would like to program with [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java\_\(programming\_language\)) language or if you aim to access products native to the ICON main network. Choose the [ICE network](https://icenetwork.io/) if you would like to program with [Solidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity) or if you aim to access products native to the [Polkadot ecosystem](https://polkadot.network/).
