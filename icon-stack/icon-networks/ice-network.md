### What is ICE?

[**ICE** ](http://icenetwork.io/)is an extension network and application hub of the ICON ecosystem<mark style="color:purple;">.</mark>&#x20;

Built with [**Substrate**](https://substrate.io/)_,_ **ICE** is the first network to use the Substrate SDK to extend the feature-set of an existing layer one blockchain protocol. In addition, **ICE** will provide the much-needed addition of EVM compatibility to the **ICON ecosystem**.&#x20;

Finally, **ICE** is the only EVM-compatible parachain that is also optimized for [**ICON’s BTP**](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/blockchain-transmission-protocol-btp-an-overview-744aaa51334e). This will position **ICE** as a potential flagship chain within the Polkadot ecosystem that showcases industry-leading cross-chain applications — all powered by ICON’s BTP.

### Key Features

**EVM & eWASM Compatible:** **ICE** is fully EVM compatible, enabling developers to iterate and innovate much faster using existing tooling and code from the Ethereum ecosystem. **ICE** is also compatible with WebAssembly, a widely supported, high-performance standard that will likely serve as the foundation of decentralised systems development.

**Integration with the Polkadot ecosystem:** As a candidate for a Polkadot parachain, a successful auction will ensure **ICE** enjoys all the benefits of the Polkadot ecosystem.\
\
**Powered by Substrate:** **ICE** is built on Substrate, an open-source blockchain development framework that powers a variety of top projects including Polkadot, Kusama, Chainlink, Moonbeam, and more. Substrate allows developers to easily and efficiently build projects that are automatically optimized for any use case without requiring forks.

**Access to a Multi-chain Ecosystem:** As a key connection between the ICON and Polkadot ecosystems, **ICE** will also provide developers with unmatched access to ICON BTP partners (including Algorand, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, Harmony, and Near), as well as their respective communities.
